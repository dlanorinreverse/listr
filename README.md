People on the internet are always looking for simple and direct answers to their questions. May it be about cooking like “How to prepare turkey?” or about technology like “**What are the best phones of 2016?**”; we want precise answers that we can read as fast as possible and learn from it immediately. And more often than not, we search Google for a question and it just returns a bunch of links leading nowhere and we end up losing some valuable time.

**Listr** is a Q&A platform that lets you ask any questions and people will answer your question *strictly* in list or step-by-step form. This makes sharing and acquiring information easier and more effective because it is just like reading a list or guide where each item contains a direct instruction or information that you answers your question.
