# What is Listr?

People on the internet are always looking for simple and direct answers to their questions. May it be about cooking like “**How to prepare turkey?**” or about technology like “**What are the best phones of 2016?**”; we want precise answers that we can read as fast as possible and learn from it immediately. And more often than not, we search Google for a question and it just returns a bunch of links leading nowhere and we end up losing some valuable time.

**Listr** is a Q&A platform that lets you ask any questions and people will answer your question *strictly* in list or step-by-step form. This makes sharing and acquiring information easier and more effective because it is just like reading a list or guide where each item contains a direct instruction or information that you answers your question.

## Anyone can use Listr.

Visitors of the site can sign up as a member providing their real personal information, full name, job, company, a short description about themselves, etc. The reason for this is that we want the information the community share in the site be as reliable as possible and what better way to do this than making people know that the answers they read come from this person, with this kind of position and experience in their company.

## Listr is friendly with advertisers.

A business doesn’t need to have a special account or to bug us to put their advertisements in the site. They can sign up and be part of the knowledge sharing community by answering questions and putting their brand into it.

For example, Del Monte Foods Inc. can answer a cooking question “**How to prepare beef steak**”. They can answer with the steps of a simple recipe while putting their brand into the ingredients needed.

## Sharing is rewarding.

Another way to assure reliability is to introduce an upvote-downvote system :arrow_up::arrow_down:, where posts with the highest upvote-downvote average come first and can be read first. And if a user receives a certain number of “commend” votes, they will be rewarded with a “Verified” (:white_check_mark:) account notifying their readers that they are reading from a verified and experienced user.

## Listr encourages knowledge-sharing.

We want to do this for the sake of knowledge. We want information to be as easily accessible as possible and we want to do this in a way as simple as possible - by providing a list. Because we may want people to be experimental as possible - to find and discover things their own way by experiencing them, we are helping them be one step ahead by sharing the basic steps.
